# notification-script
This is a python script to send a notification to the desktop. This was made using Python: I used Plyer specifically to implement this. 
To install plyer, 

```

pip install plyer

```

is sufficient 

In order to make this an executable file, I used PyInstaller, which I installed using ``` pip install pyinstaller ```
